Physicist, specialized in optical properties of semiconductor (nano)materials. After finishing my predoctoral stage in Madrid, I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/ifp/research-groups/solid-state-materials-research-group-eickhoff/team-research-group-eickhoff/dr-manuel-alonso-orts) (Germany). I am not only interested in research; I enjoy just as much or more learning, talking and communicating scientific topics that I find interesting.
