{{% lottie src="lottie/hello.tgs" width="75%" %}}

First blog. Here begins an adventure that I had been wanting to start for a long time (years).

## Who are we?

[<img draggable="false" class="icon" alt="physichemically" src="/icon/logo-physichemically.svg">](/) is created by [Rodrigo Alcaraz de la Osa]({{< ref "/sobre-mi" >}}) in 2020 as a website where to share mainly [📚&nbsp;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">**Physics and Chemistry notes**</span>]({{< ref "/apuntes" >}}) and [👐🏼&nbsp;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">**tutorials**</span>]({{< ref "/tutoriales" >}}).

In 2021 it transitions to a more *impersonal* website, better prepared and open for future collaborations. [Click here if you want to meet the **team** behind it]({{< ref "/equipo" >}}).


## Why this blog?

Our main intention with this website is to provide [📚&nbsp;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">**Physics and Chemistry notes**</span>]({{< ref "/apuntes" >}}) to our students and to anyone else who might be interested, as well as sharing [👐🏼&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">**tutorials**</span>]({{< ref "/tutoriales" >}}) and collect [🔗&nbsp;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">**online resources**</span>]({{< ref "/recursos-online" >}}).

We think that a **blog** is the perfect addition to be able to debate about **news** with a much more **dynamic** content.

## What are we going to talk about on this blog?
In this blog you will find **opinion** articles, **curiosities** about **science** in general and posts related to our **interests**, which include, among others:

- ✈️ Travel
- 🎸 Music
- 🎮 Video games
- ⚛️ *Photons*

## Who is this blog for?

The posts in this blog are aimed at our students and anyone else who is curious about science and/or shares any of our interests.
