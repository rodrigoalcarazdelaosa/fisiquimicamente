## 4. Golden Rain
> Some precipitates are so spectacular that they almost turn them into works of art.

## 5. Spectra in Discharge Tubes
> Another search for color and for deciphering the bar codes hidden in each radiation.

{{< vimeo 584055552 >}}

## 6. Luminescence
> Fireflies? Algae? Luminescent phenomena are always the most evocative.

## 8. Newton's Cradle
> A very well known device that does not prevent new studies every year that are equally interesting.

## 9. Siempre fuimos nómadas (in Spanish)
> Dramatizing passages of science, like the best Sagan here, is something that usually works very well with students.
